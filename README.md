Welcome to Monad's tech interview!

This is a simple project to get us started and provide us a base to talk about.  
During the interview, we'll walk through the code and discuss the design and implementation.

You are not expected to have written any additional code, although if you want to do so before your interview so you 
have something ready to talk about, that is fine.  It is your choice, neither choice will affect your interview outcome.  Choose
whichever you are most comfortable with.

You can expect to discuss:
* Project structure
* Code design
* Code implementation
* Testing
* Error handling
* Performance
* Security
* Scalability
* Monitoring
* Idiomatic Go

And anything else you feel is important to writing quality, scaleable and maintainable code.  We look forward to chatting!
